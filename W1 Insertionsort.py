'''Insertion Sort
Sorts an array in place by starting from the 2nd element.
moves element to the left until it is larger than the number on its left.
Outer loop: runs n-1 times
Inner loop: runs n-1 times
Optimisation: Instead of swapping each time, store the identified variable in a temp var.
              Take this temp var and move it until the item on the left is smaller.
              This reduces the number of assignments.
Time Complexity: O(n^2)'''
