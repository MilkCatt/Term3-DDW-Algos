'''Bubble Sort
Sorts an array in place by comparing the pairs from left to right.
The algorithm will swap the 2 numbers if the number on the left is larger.
Outer loop: runs n-1 times (unoptimised)
Inner loop: runs n-1 times (unoptimised)
Optimisation 1: Outer loop stops when items are no longer swapped -> array si already sorted
Optimisation 2a: reduce inner index by 1 for each iteration (last 2 items will be sorted after each outer iteration)
Optimisation 2b: set the inner index to the index of the last item swapped (follows logic of 2a)
Computation Time : O(n^2)'''
